Ball and brick game with login

1. The main purpose of this project is to have a score board on a server and any user can login and generate a new player or resume an older run, until their health reaches ZERO. The other purpose is to master collision detection and other game-related mechanics. 

2. I also plan to reuse the server-side of the application for multiple applications, games or not, in the future.

3. Current TODO's:
    /. Good hunting!
    a. Build a health bar.
    b. Make start game/logout buttons
    c. Make the actual game
    d. Finish up login/logout features
